1.	Launch the application. Upon launching the application, the user will be directed to TimeKeeperPro’s Login Page. With the use of authentication, the user will be required to enter valid login credentials (Username and Password) in order to gain access to all features. Otherwise, a login failure error message will be displayed.
2.	Alternatively, a user without an account can register for one bY clicking on the "REGISTER" text that appears below the login button to be redirected to the Registration page.
3.	On the registation page, the user will be required to create sign-in credentials (username and password) with another password field for validation.
4.	Once the user exists in the database, the user can redirect him/herself to login page (by clicking on the Login text at the bottom of the Registration page) to log in a new registered user.
5.	Once logged in, the user will be directed to the Category-creation display as a Home Page, with pre-populated categories, where the user will be able to create a new category for a specific task. 
6.	To create a new category, the user simply has to enter the name of their desired category and click on the “ADD CATEGORY” button, which will then append to the list of categories below.
7.	A user will be able to create a new task within a specific category by either clicking on the name of the desired category within the list, or can make use of the navigation menu at the bottom of the screen. To create a task, the user is required to provide a task name, description, category, date and time, the option to add a photo, as well as a daily goal (in hours) option to track the time spent on each task. After all fields have been entered, the user can then click on “SAVE ENTRY” to save this data, after which it will be displayed below for the user to see. NOTE: An error will display if an image is not inserted, so ensure an image is inserted.
8.	To view the list of tasks created by the user, the user can either click on the “VIEW TASKS” button after the data has been displayed. Alternatively, the last button on the far right of the navigation menu can be used. NOTE: With the use of a progress bar, the Green progress bar indicates a task completed by the user, whereas a Red progress bar indicates an incomplete task- meaning the user is required to complete his/her daily goal hours.
9.	A User will also be able to Report on a user’s tasks/category through the Report page. In order to do this, the user will have to select a category from a dropdownlist, followed by a task from the dropdownlist and then proceed to providing a description. Once completed, the user can “Submit” the report.
10.	For a user to view the amount of time a user has spent on a task within a specific category, the user can navigate to the Statistics page. On this page, the user will be able to view a graphical representation of his/her productivity by first setting a date, and then clicking on the “generate graph” button to view the bar graph with the respective hours for a task/s.
11.	Once the user is satisfied, they have the option to exit the program by clicking on the “LOGOUT” button on the top right-hand corner of each page. Consequently, this will redirect the user to the Login Page
